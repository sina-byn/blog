        <p>
          I'm a front-end developer specializing in React and Vue, with a strong interest in
          exploring the depths of Node.js. I believe in expanding my tech stackâ€”why not code in Go?
          I also have a deep appreciation for C++ and am eager to dive into Rust. Well, isn't that a
          lot to learn? Then let's get started right away, as time is short.
